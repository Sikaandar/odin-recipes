This the first project i built in my full stack web developer journey with the odin project foundation course.

In the completion of this project the key learnings I acquired were,

Setting up a html webpage and linking webpages to each other.
Setting up Github and using Git commands like git status, git add, git commit and git push
Adding images and links to the webpages.
Using ordered and unordered lists.

P.S: English is not my first language so please excuse the grammatical mistake in this file. i am trying my best to learn the english language. Also, if you are reading this file please give your valuable feedback on this project it will help me in my further journey with fullstack development.
